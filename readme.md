# React ServerSide Render with Bundlesplit built with EsBuild

This is an example of how to build a react application with SSR support and bundlesplit with remote fetched data.

This example is build with [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) which makes the server super fast.

I have not configured esbuild in watch mode, but that is posible, and in that way to make it even faster on reload.
